              In 1999 <code>Counter-Strike</code> was released as a mod for Half-Life. As the game progressed from a beta to a full release, it refined the classic gameplay that has come to define competitive shooters and produced a dedicated community that has followed the game since its first release.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through each of its iterations – 1.6, Source, and Global Offensive – <code>Counter-Strike</code> has been the de facto benchmark of a player’s first person shooter skill. Teams from around the world demonstrate their abilities and strategies in local, regional, and international tournaments streamed to millions of viewers across the globe.

          <h1>Utility</h1>
          </header>
          <p>Utility is synonymous with <code>Counter-Strike</code>. Their usefulness and importance can only be challenged with the in-game weaponry. Grenades have been present across all iterations of <code>Counter-Strike</code>. It can change the course of a game, allow strategic play and impact a vital round. In competitive play, utility separates the wheat from the shaft, the professionals from the amateurs. Those who know the correct usage of grenades can elevate their level of play to unforeseen heights. However, one might wonder, what is the practical usage of utility in <code>Counter-Strike</code></p>
          <p>Utility:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HE Grenades</li>
            <li>Smoke Grenades</li>
